FastAddons
===

FastAddons allows you to enable and disable restartless add-ons from a toolbar
button with one click and without going through the Add-on Manager.

It is meant primarily as an experiment to get a hang of the [CustomizableUI.jsm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/CustomizableUI.jsm) API.
